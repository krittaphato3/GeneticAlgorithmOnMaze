# 🏃‍♂️ Maze Runner: High-Performance Pathfinding Visualization

A Java Swing application designed to visualize and compare pathfinding algorithms on complex maze environments. This project features a **benchmark Dijkstra algorithm**, an **optimized A* Search**, and a **Hyper-Optimized Genetic Algorithm** capable of solving large-scale mazes (up to 100x100) in milliseconds.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Algorithms
1.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Acts as the "Gold Standard" benchmark. Guarantees the mathematically shortest path.
2.  **A* (A-Star) Search:** An optimized heuristic solver using Manhattan Distance for rapid pathfinding.
3.  **Genetic Algorithm (High-Performance):** A custom implementation focused on raw speed and scalability.
    * **Architecture:** Pure 1D Arithmetic (No object overhead in hot loops).
    * **Optimization:** Uses a Flattened 1D Boolean Array for cache-friendly memory access.
    * **Performance:** Utilizes `parallelStream()` for multi-threaded evaluation.
    * **Mutation:** Implements "Geometric Skip Mutation" (`Math.log`) to reduce random number generation by ~96%.

### 🎨 UI/UX "Pro Edition"
* **Dark Mode Dashboard:** Modern, eye-friendly interface.
* **Dynamic Rendering:** Auto-scales mazes to fit the window.
* **Zoom & Pan:** Mouse-centric zoom and drag support for inspecting large maps.
* **Interactive Grid:** Hover over cells to see coordinate and weight data.

## ⚡ How to Run

### Prerequisites

  * **Java JDK 8** or higher installed.
  * Terminal / Command Prompt access.

### Option 1: Compilation via Terminal (Recommended)

1.  **Navigate to the project root folder:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/MazeRunner_Project
    ```

2.  **Compile the source code:**
    This command compiles all modules and places them in a `bin` directory.

    ```bash
    javac -d bin -cp src src/Main.java src/models/*.java src/utils/*.java src/ui/*.java src/algorithms/*.java
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

### Option 2: Running in an IDE

  * Open the folder `MazeRunner_Project` in VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse.
  * **Do not** just open the `src` folder; the IDE needs the root folder to find the `data/` directory.
  * Run `src/Main.java`.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

1.  **Load Map:** Click the "Load Map" button in the sidebar. Select a `.txt` file from the `data/` folder.
2.  **Run Benchmark:** Click "Run Dijkstra" to see the optimal path and cost. This sets the baseline.
3.  **Run Genetic Algo:** Click "Run Genetic Algorithm".
      * Watch the console log at the bottom for performance stats.
      * If the path is not found immediately, click it again (GA is probabilistic).
4.  **Inspect:**
      * **Scroll Wheel:** Zoom in/out (zooms toward mouse cursor).
      * **Click & Drag:** Pan around the map when zoomed in.

## 🧬 Technical Deep Dive: The Genetic Algorithm

The `GeneticSolver` included in this project uses a **Pure 1D Arithmetic** approach to bypass Java's Garbage Collection overhead.

  * **Flattened Memory:** Instead of checking `grid[r][c].isWall` (which causes pointer chasing), the map is converted to a `boolean[]` array.
  * **Boundary Padding:** The map is wrapped in a "virtual wall" border, removing the need for `if (x < 0 || x >= width)` boundary checks inside the simulation loop.
  * **Logarithmic Skip Mutation:** Instead of checking every gene for mutation, we calculate *how many genes to skip* before the next mutation occurs, significantly reducing CPU cycles.
